# Home Handyman Portfolio

# Introduction

Welcome to the readme. I wish to make a portfolio which is clear, beautiful and useful. If you have anything to add or change, just come on, and I will give everyone GitHub collaboration authority to change anything!

React Native is based on JavaScript or TypeScript. As a script rather than a programming language, it can render a web page and run dynamically, but can hardly manipulate a database or process complicated interactions. So, I choose just to display beautiful images rather than a giant app.

We have researched Mrapplicance, Walmart and Homedepot applications, and we decided to get the pros of them to our portfolioðŸ˜‰. Time is short, let us do it right now~

## Categories for all

When a customer clicks one category,e.g. Power tools, I want to jump to a new category page, with pictures and names on the page. Everyone can do one category on the table. Please give a return to home button on the left up.
